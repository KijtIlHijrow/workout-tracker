# Claude Code Configuration

## Project Preferences

### Git Workflow
- **Never use git worktrees** - always work directly on main branch
- Single branch workflow preferred for this project

### Conventions
- Use metric units (kg for weight)
- Optimize for mobile (iPhone) usage
- **Priority: Extremely fast loading and minimal code**
  - Keep codebase as small as possible
  - Minimize lines of code
  - Optimize for speed above all else
